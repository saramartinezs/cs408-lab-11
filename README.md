# Lab 11

## Overview

In this project, a simple inventory app was created using the AWS endpoints that were created in the last module. In the app, you can add and delete items from the database. 

Note that to see the item you have added to the database or deleted from the database, you must click on the "Load Data" button. 

### To view the web page
Clone the repository and open in VSCode. Use the Live Preview extension to view the web page. You can either view it within VSCode or in a web browser. Add items to the database by filling out the required information. Click the "Add Item" button and then click "Load Data" to see the item in the table. To delete an item, click on the corresponding "Delete" button and then click "Load Data".
